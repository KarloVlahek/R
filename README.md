In the first problem, I observe simple linear models of creatinine clearance rates (a measure of kidney health) and age.

In the second, I observe sample of 1501 Mercedes S-Class S550 cars offered for sale in the U.S. viacars.com. I use ggplot to make a scatterplot of price versus  mileage (x), faceted by year.

Finally, I observe bike-sharing systems in Washington D.C. to visualize some simple relationships among the vast amount of data available.

Kudos to Dr. James Scott for the sets!
